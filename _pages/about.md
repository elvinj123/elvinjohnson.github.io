Hi, I'm Elvin, a second semester's Masters student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus on machine learning and computer vision from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh. Prior to beginning my masters, I had opportunity of gaining hands on experience in this field, through the various projects and internships I had successfully completed. During my most recent experience as an intern with Protiviti in the Data and Analytics team, I interacted with clients and worked various projects involving machine learning, data science, optimization. I also collaborated with the team to initiate work in image analytics at the department, after which I was assigned the task of developing a solution for a use case requested by a client, which I accomplished successfully. </p>
<p> 
During my tenure as an undergraduate student as part of the AI team at the Centre of Excellence lab, I worked on detection of deep fakes videos using Machine Learning with the help of state of the art facilities like the NVIDIA DGX-1 AI Supercomputer, which was used for processing huge amounts of data and training heavy machine learning models. After successful completion of this project, I had the opportunity of presenting our research paper and work at an international conference held at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, after which the work was published in an international journal.</p>
<p> 
I was also a part of the team that made it through to the finals of the National level Smart India Hackathon 2020, where I had worked on building/training machine learning models for text classification. It was during my tenure as an undergraduate that I had also completed a project based internship on detection and classification of skin cancer using machine learning. </p>
